# Slides

This directory contains a demonstration of slides using [Revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/presentations/revealjs.html), an open source HTML presentation framework.

There is an extension installed: [reveal-header](https://github.com/shafayetShafee/reveal-header). It enables the slide header used in the demo presentation. There are many other Quarto extensions [available](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/listing-revealjs.html).
